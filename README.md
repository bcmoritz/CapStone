Within the life insurance industry, underwriting can be a time-consuming task which can involve a degree of subjectivity across customers. Our goal is to determine whether machine learning model(s) can be used to classify potential life insurance customers into specific risk categories accurately and efficiently thereby eliminating any subjectivity in the process, reducing time spent, and ultimately saving on costs. The best model will be selected based on its accuracy and time taken for prediction.
